// depOrderTemplate computes the "referential depth" of tables based on
// foreign-key constraints. Note that this only works with acyclic FK
// dependency graphs. This is ok because CRDB's lack of deferrable
// constraints means that a cyclic dependency graph would be unusable.
// Once CRDB has deferrable constraints, the need for computing this
// dependency ordering goes away.
//
// The query is structured as follows:
//   - tables: A list of (schema, table) pairs for all tables in the db.
//   - refs: Maps referring tables (child) to referenced tables
//     (parent). Table self-references are excluded from this query.
//   - roots: Tables that contain no FK references to ensure that
//     cyclical references remain unprocessed.
//   - depths: A recursive CTE that builds up from the roots. In each
//     step of the recursion, we select the child tables of the previous
//     iteration whose parent table has a known depth and use the maximum
//     parent's depth to derive the child's (updated) depth. The recursion
//     halts when the previous iteration contains only leaf tables.
//   - The top-level query then finds the maximum depth for each table.
//     Any tables for which a depth cannot be computed (e.g. cyclical
//     references) are assigned a sentinel value.
//
// One limitation in this query is that the information_schema doesn't
// appear to provide any way to know about the schema in which the
// referenced table is defined.
